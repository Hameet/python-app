# First python app

## Thoughts

* I just wanted to have a go at Python as I was curious about it
* I found a lot of similarities between the logic of javascript and python
* It was easy enough to follow the instructions of the tutorial but I did have some OS issues
* It took a while to get the mysql database working as it required root access on Ubuntu
* I also found the backend to be rather quite simple compared to javascript which clearly shows how python is more powerful
* Will definitely play around with python more in the future
